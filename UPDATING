This file documents some of the problems you may encounter when upgrading
your ports.  We try our best to minimize these disruptions, but sometimes
they are unavoidable.

You should get into the habit of checking this file for changes each time
you update your ports collection, before attempting any port upgrades.

20150822:
  AFFECTS: users of print/ghostscript*
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

 print/ghostscript{7,8,9,9-agpl} have been split into
 print/ghostscript{7,8,9,9-agpl}-{base,x11}.
 print/ghostscript*-nox11 ports have been removed.

 The -base installs Ghostscript binaries, libgs, and other data files
 and it depends on no X11 library.  The -x11 installs a small shared
 library to enable x11* devices in the installed -base package.

 In most cases, Ghostscript is installed as a dependency.  A port/package
 which requires Ghostscript will automatically pick up -base, and
 when x11* devices required it will pick up -x11 in addition.

 If one wants to install Ghostscript manually and full compatibility
 with the previous versions, just install -x11 because it installs
 -base as a dependency.  Combination of the two provides the same
 functionality as before.

20150821:
  AFFECTS: users of security/openssh-portable
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  OpenSSH 7.0 disables support for:
    * SSH protocol 1
    * 1024-bit diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 key exchange
    * ssh-dss, ssh-dss-cert-* host and user keys
    * legacy v00 cert format

  See http://www.openssh.com/txt/release-7.0 for more information and
  http://www.openssh.com/legacy.html for how to re-enable some of these
  algorithms.

20150820:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ghc and */hs-*
  AUTHOR: haskell@FreeBSD.org

  The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compiler has been updated to version
  7.10.2 and Haskell Platform has been removed.  As a result, it is
  recommended to rebuild or reinstall all the dependent ports and the
  lang/ghc port itself in one of the following ways:

  # portmaster -w -r ghc
    or
  # portupgrade -fr lang/ghc

  In case of pkg(8), it is probably safer to remove all the GHC-dependent
  packages along with GHC and reinstall everything from scratch.  For
  example:

  # pkg query "%ro" ghc > ghc-pkgs.txt
  # pkg delete -y lang/ghc

  In ghc-pkgs.txt, check and remove all the packages that have been moved,
  then:

  # pkg install -y `cat ghc-pkgs.txt`

20150818:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/s6
  AUTHOR: Colin Booth <colin@heliocat.net>

  s6-notifywhenup has been removed as of v2.2.0.0. Any run scripts 
  using readyness notification must be updated to use a notification 
  fd instead.

  s6-svc options have changed for sending syncronous up/down timeouts. 
  Any management or wrapper scripts using those options will need to
  be updated.

20150817:
  AFFECTS: everybody who still uses <UNIQUENAME>_SET/UNSET in make.conf
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The use of <UNIQUENAME>_SET/UNSET has been deprecated for a long time,
  replaced by <OPTIONS_NAME>_SET/UNSET.  It is now not supported any more.
  A warning will be issued telling you what to do, for example:

    $ make
    /!\ WARNING /!\
    You are using perl_SET which is not supported any more, use:
    lang_perl5.20_SET= DEBUG

20150816:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/s6
  AUTHOR: Colin Booth <colin@heliocat.net>

  s6-notifywhenup is deprecated and will be removed in the next version
  of s6. Any run scripts depending on that program should be updated to
  use an in-servicedir notification-fd file as described under
  "Readyness notification support" in s6-supervise.html.

20150812:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/icinga and net-mgmt/icinga2
  AUTHOR: lme@FreeBSD.org

  The Icinga port has been split into two ports: net-mgmt/icinga-core
  which contains the Icinga 1.x backend and net-mgmt/icinga-classicweb
  which contains the Icinga classic web (CGI) interface. The latter can
  be both used with Icinga 1.x and the Icinga 2 port (net-mgmt/icinga2).
  A new meta-port net-mgmt/icinga was added which depends on both new
  ports, so updating the Icinga port should be transparent.
  
20150812:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/moosefs-master and other moosefs packages
  AUTHOR: feld@FreeBSD.org

  MooseFS ports have been updated to 2.0.72-1. Upstream has been
  providing a private package repository to distribute newer releases of
  MooseFS. These changes have now made it into the ports tree. This has
  resulted in splitting up the sysutils/moosefs-master port into several
  new ports:

  sysutils/moosefs-cli
  sysutils/moosefs-cgi
  sysutils/moosefs-cgiserv
  sysutils/moosefs-metalogger
  sysutils/moosefs-netdump

  You may need to install these additional ports/packages to restore the
  complete functionality of your MooseFS cluster. Please review the
  upstream documentation.

  http://moosefs.com/documentation/moosefs-2-0.html

20150809:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/xfce4-power-manager
  AUTHOR: olivierd@FreeBSD.org

  After upgrading to 1.5.2, by default a label is displayed next to the
  panel icon (it shows percentage and remaining time).

  To hide this label, a new property /xfce4-power-manager/show-panel-label
  must be created:

  xfconf-query -c xfce4-power-manager \
      -p /xfce4-power-manager/show-panel-label -n -t int -s 0

  Possible values are:
  - 0 -> does not display label
  - 1 -> displays only percentage
  - 2 -> displays only remaining time
  - 3 -> displays only percentage and remaining time (default value)

20150806:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  After upgrading to 2.2.2, manually update all packages that depend on
  any of the libraries provided by LibreSSL (libssl, libcrypto and
  libtls) since the versions of these libraries have changed. Normally,
  you can obtain the list of dependent software by running the following
  command:

  # pkg info -r libressl

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on libressl to avoid dangling
  shared library dependencies. Poudriere and pkg handle this correctly,
  portmaster and portupgrade users can use the following to rebuild all
  dependent ports.

  Portmaster users:
      portmaster -r libressl
  Portupgrade users:
      portupgrade -fr security/libressl

20150805:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/tracker
  AUTHOR: kwm@FreeBSD.org

  The new tracker version does not build if the old version is installed.

  # pkg delete -f tracker

  After use your upgrade tool of choice.

20150802:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/opensmtpd
  AUTHOR: ashish@FreeBSD.org

  After upgrading, you will need to review all your configuration, as
  there are some configuration changes between 5.4.x and 5.7.1.

20150726:
  AFFECTS: users of ukrainian/monacofonts
  AUTHOR: mi@aldan.algebra.com

  The destination-directory used by monacofonts port was altered.
  The fonts-location changed from koi8u-monaco/ to koi8-u-monaco/

  Users are advised to modify the path set in their xorg.conf files.

20150720:
  AFFECTS: users of print/texlive-base and other TeXLive packages
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  TeXLive in Ports Collection has been updated to TL2015.  To upgrade
  installed old packages, upgrading of "tex-*" packages is required.

  If you have a problem with upgrading, please send it to
  freebsd-tex@FreeBSD.org and/or file a PR.

20150711:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/gdal
  AUTHOR: sunpoet@FreeBSD.org

  Due to changes in header files, please deinstall gdal first while updating
  from 1.x to 2.0.

20150708:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  After upgrading to 2.2.1, manually update all packages that depend on
  any of the libraries provided by LibreSSL (libssl, libcrypto and
  libtls) since the versions of these libraries have changed. Normally,
  you can obtain the list of dependent software by running the following
  command:

  pkg query -e '%n = libressl' %ro

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on libressl to avoid dangling
  shared library dependencies.

20150707:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/netmagis-*
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  Netmagis-* ports have been upgraded to 2.3.0. Upgrading from
  previous version require a database schema upgrade.
  See http://netmagis.org/upgrade.html

20150702:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/ffmpeg
  AUTHOR: riggs@FreeBSD.org

  ffmpeg has been updated to the latest version from the 2.7 branch.
  If you are using binary pkg, 'pkg upgrade' will do the right thing.
  Users of portmaster/portupgrade must rebuild all ports that depend
  on it.

  Portmaster users:
      portmaster -w -r ffmpeg
  Portupgrade users:
      portupgrade -fr multimedia/ffmpeg

20150702:
  AFFECTS: users of net/ptpd2-devel
  AUTHOR: skreuzer@FreeBSD.org

  net/ptpd2 has been upgraded to version 2.3.1
  net/ptpd2-devel is now deprecated and has been removed

  If using portupgrade:
  # portupgrade -o net/ptpd2 net/ptpd2-devel

  If using portmaster:
  # portmaster -o net/ptpd2 net/ptpd2-devel

20150628:
  AFFECTS: users of www/varnish, www/pecl-varnish,
  www/varnish-libvmod-header, www/varnish-nagios
  AUTHOR: feld@FreeBSD.org

  Varnish 3.x has reached End of Life status and has been removed from
  the ports tree. If you were using www/varnish we urge you to to update
  to www/varnish4. The upgrade guide can be found here:

  https://www.varnish-cache.org/docs/trunk/whats-new/upgrade-4.0.html
  
  www/varnish-libvmod-header and www/varnish-nagios have been updated to
  versions that work with Varnish 4.x. You should not lose access to
  this software.

  www/pecl-varnish was updated to the latest release which has added
  support for Varnish 4.x. Please note that it appears some
  functionality has been lost. This is unfortunate but out of our
  control. Details can be found here:

  http://pecl.php.net/package-changelog.php?package=varnish

  If for some reason you need www/varnish to exist in your ports tree
  for a bit longer you may consider instead following the 2015Q2 branch.
  Do note however that Varnish 3.x will not be receiving updates or
  security patches from upstream.

20150624:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/p5-Test-Tester and devel/p5-Test-use-ok
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  The Test::Tester and Test::use::ok modules have been rolled into
  devel/p5-Test-Simple, and are included in perl 5.22. The p5-Test-Tester
  and p5-Test-use-ok modules will be removed in one month.

  If you use either of those ports and have perl-5.22 installed:

      pkg delete p5-Test-Tester p5-Test-use-ok

  If you use either of those ports and have perl-5.20 or lower installed:

      portmaster -o devel/p5-Test-Simple p5-Test-Tester
      portmaster -o devel/p5-Test-Simple p5-Test-use-ok

20150615:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org 

  After upgrading libressl, manually update all packages that depend on
  this library since its version has changed. Normally, you can obtain the 
  list of dependent software by running the following command:

  pkg query -e '%n = libressl' %ro

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on libressl to avoid dangling
  shared library dependencies.

20150614:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/libmusicbrainz5
  AUTHOR: jhale@FreeBSD.org

  libmusicbrainz5 has been updated to 5.1.0.  Please rebuild all ports that
  depend on it.  PORTREVISIONS have been bumped on dependent ports.

  If you use portmaster:
        portmaster -w -r libmusicbrainz5
  If you use portupgrade:
        portupgrade -fr audio/libmusicbrainz5

20150613:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/avidemux26-*
  AUTHOR: riggs@FreeBSD.org

  avidemux26 has been renamed to avidemux
  If you are using binary pkg, 'pkg upgrade' will do the right thing.
  Users of portmaster/portupgrade have to take a manual step:
  Portmaster users:
      portmaster -o multimedia/avidemux multimedia/avidemux26
  Portupgrade users:
      portupgrade -o multimedia/avidemux multimedia/avidemux26

20150610:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql84-server
  AUTHOR: girgen@FreeBSD.org

  PostgreSQL-8.4 EOL was reached in July 2014. To upgrade to a later version of
  choice, you need to do a dump+restore of the database.
  Please follow the instructions at:

     http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/static/install-upgrading.html

20150527:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/xfce4-power-manager
  AUTHOR: olivierd@FreeBSD.org

  Before upgrading, you must stop xfce4-power-manager daemon:

    xfce4-power-manager --quit

20150519:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/webmin and sysutils/usermin
  AUTHOR: olgeni@FreeBSD.org

  After upgrading to Perl 5.20 the /usr/bin/perl link will no longer
  be available. You will have to check your perl-path files and
  change the path of the Perl interpreter to "/usr/local/bin/perl":

    /usr/local/etc/webmin/perl-path
    /usr/local/etc/usermin/perl-path

20150513:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5*
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The default Perl version has been switched to Perl 5.20.  If you are using
  binary packages to upgrade your system, you do not have anything to do, pkg
  upgrade will do the right thing.  For the other people, assuming you are
  migrating from 5.18 to 5.20, do:

  Portupgrade users:
	portupgrade -o lang/perl5.20 -f lang/perl5.18

	portupgrade -f `pkg shlib -R libperl.so.5.18|tail +2`

  Portmaster users:
	portmaster -o lang/perl5.20 lang/perl5.18

	portmaster -f `pkg shlib -R libperl.so.5.18|tail +2`

  NOTE:
    Perl has been removed from base more than ten years ago, so it was way past
    time for the /usr/bin/perl symlink to be removed from the port.  If for
    some strange reason, you still need it, you will have to create it
    manually.

  IMPORTANT:
    In case you have not updated your system in a while, and specifically,
    followed the 20141126 instructions regarding the new Perl layout, you
    should follow those more extensive instructions rather than the
    conservative presented here.

20150510:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix mail/postfix-current
  AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  The following OPTIONS where renamed to match the default used in most all other ports
  - SASL2 -> SASL
  - OPENLDAP -> LDAP

  If any of the old OPTIONS was enabled before, please re-run "make config".

20150508:
  AFFECTS: users of www/iojs
  AUTHOR: linpct@gmail.com

  iojs has been updated to 2.0.0. The binary modules may need to be
  rebuilt due to V8 version ABI change.

20150506:
  AFFECTS: users of net/asterisk13 with PJSIP (default on) and SRTP (default off) options enabled
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  This applies ONLY TO USERS COMPILING FROM PORTS:
  To avoid dependency problems, you must remove the pjsip port
  before upgrading asterisk13.

    # pkg delete pjsip
    # portmaster -a

  These steps are unnecessary for those using binary packages.

  Please see the 20150323 entry for background about this problem.

20150501:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/qgis
  AUTHOR: brd@FreeBSD.org

  Following OPTIONS have been renamed in 2.8.1_1 to match upstream:

  - MAPSERVER to SERVER

20150427:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/opensmtpd
  AUTHOR: ashish@FreeBSD.org

  Following OPTIONS are being removed in 5.4.5p1:

  - LDAP
  - SQLITE
  - MYSQL
  - PGSQL
  - REDIS 
 
  They are disabled/removed in upstream since 5.4.4p1, but did not get removed
  from port.

20150420:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/icu
  AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  icu has been updated to 55.1. Please rebuild all ports that depends on it

  If you use portmaster:
        portmaster -w -r icu
  If you use portupgrade:
        portupgrade -fr devel/icu

20150419
  AFFECTS: Users of emulators/wine-devel
  AUTHOR: gerald@FreeBSD.org


  The COMPHOLIO option in emulators/wine-devel has been renamed to
  STAGING to align with the upstream evolution of that project.

20150417:
  AFFECTS: Users of audio/bcg729
  AUTHOR: tijl@FreeBSD.org

  The Mediastreamer plugin included in this package has been separated into
  a new port audio/msbcg729.

20150409:
  AFFECTS: User of security/sguil
  AUTHOR: feld@FreeBSD.org

  security/sguil was erroneously provisioned a UID that conflicted with
  the dns/dnscrypt-proxy port. A new UID and GID of 991 has been issued.

  Existing users will be able to upgrade the sguil packages without
  issue. The existing UID will continue to be used. If you do a clean
  install of security/sguil on a new server and migrate files or
  intentionally delete the sguil user and group and reinstall you may
  run into permissions issues.

  Examples include the /var/run/sguild and /usr/local/etc/sguild directories.

20150406:
  AFFECTS: User of emulators/xen emulators/xl and sysutils/xen-tools
  AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  sysutils/xen-tools has been renamed sysutils/xen-guest-tools
  emulators/xl has been renamed sysutils/xen-tools
  emulators/xen has been renamed emulators/xen-kernel
  A new emulators/xen has been introduced, it is a metaport that depends on
  emulators/xen-kernel and sysutils/xen-tools

20150403:
  AFFECTS: Users of irc/rbot
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  Ruby Bot now has a new upstream maintainer.  The project has been updated
  to work with Ruby 2.0+.  Some migration is needed to move away from
  BDB regristry files.  The guide for that is at
  https://github.com/ruby-rbot/rbot/wiki/MigrationGuide

  rbotdb can be used to backup a BDB database and then restore it to a working
  format for the new rbot. Update your conf.yaml after with 'core.db: tc'
  once converted.

20150331:
AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  Subversion modules are no longer activated in httpd.conf!
  To activate the subversion apache modules a dedicated file
  will be installed as modules.d/220_subversion.conf

20150324:
  AFFECTS: Users of dns/bind9*
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  This is only for FreeBSD 10.0+.

  BIND auto chroot has been added back to the named rc script.  As enabling it
  by default would most certainly break people's setup, it is not.  To enable
  it, and chroot it in /var/named, add the following line to your rc.conf file:

  named_chrootdir="/var/named"

  On first launch, the rc script will move the /usr/local/etc/namedb directory
  into the chroot, and create a symlink to it.

  Note that, if you're running from within a jail, you need to have a
  /var/named/dev devfs created beforehand, with the null and random devices.

20150323:
  AFFECTS: Users of net/asterisk* and net/pjsip ports
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  Due to conflicts between base OpenSSL and ports provided OpenSSL
  library, which is required by net/libsrtp, the srtp support has
  to be removed from the default asterisk13 port configuration,
  otherwise a not working binary would be generated.

  To get SRTP support working in the asterisk ports make sure all
  dependencies are linked against the same SSL library implementation
  to avoid runtime conflicts. On 10.1 everything will work fine
  unless ports SSL libraries are explicitly installed. On older OS
  versions(10.0 and earlier) you will need to compile all ports
  with WITH_OPENSSL_PORT=yes.

  To get working SRTP support in asterisk13 with the pjsip backend
  it is also needed to enable the EXTSRTP option in the pjsip port.

  If the CURL option is enabled also make sure the ftp/curl port
  is using a GSSAPI implementation linking to the same SSL
  implementation the other ports are using (BASE or NONE if you're
  using base OpenSSL, GSSAPI_HEIMDAL GSSAPI_MIT otherwise). If an
  incompatible option is being used the curl module will cause
  asterisk to fail on startup due to mixing calls to OpenSSL from
  base and from ports.

20150322:
  AFFECTS: Users of security/openssh-portable
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  The port now uses VersionAddendum for the port version string. Setting
  the value to "none" in your sshd_config and restarting openssh will allow
  removing the version from the banner.

20150321:
  AFFECTS: Users of x11-servers/xorg-server and other X servers
  AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  All fonts ports have been modified to respect XDG and install in
  share/fonts

  The Xorg servers now are looking there by default

  If you experience font related issues, view the output of

  # fc-list

  If the list appears incomplete or has fonts still pointing to
  /usr/local/lib/X11/fonts you may forcibly update the font cache:

  # fc-cache -fs

20150317:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/openoffice-4 and editors/openoffice-devel
  AUTHOR: truckman@FreeBSD.org

  Contrary to what is stated in pkg-message, openoffice-4 and
  openoffice-devel have stored user settings in ~/.openoffice.org-devel/4
  since r325370 (2013-08-25). This update expects user settings to reside
  in the more standard ~/.openoffice.org/4.

  To preserve your user settings, rename or copy them from
  ~/.openoffice.org-devel/4 to ~/.openoffice.org/4. when installing this
  update to apache-openoffice-4.1.1_7 or
  apache-openoffice-devel-4.2.1652526_2,3.

20150313:
  AFFECTS: users of net/serviio
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  The Java Polling Watch Service used in Serviio 1.5.1 is fixed. If you
  unchecked "Keep library automatically updated" with 1.5 (as recommended
  in the 20150206 entry) you can enable it again.

20150309:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/netdisco
  AUTHOR: dgeo@centrale-marseille.fr

  netdisco version has been upgraded to netdisco2

  After upgrading, you will need to review all your configuration, as
  this new version won't read old config files.
  You'll be able to keep your data though netdisco-deploy command

20150305:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-wm/xfce4 and multimedia/xfce4-parole
  AUTHOR: olivierd@FreeBSD.org

  Xfce 4.12 has been imported. Please use the following instructions to
  upgrade.

  For package users:
  # pkg upgrade

  For ports users:
  # portmaster -a
  # portmaster x11-wm/xfce4

  GStreamer 1.0 is enabled by default in Parole media player.

  Xfce 4.12 now depends of Adwaita icon theme. If you are upgrading from
  Xfce 4.10 you probably still have the Tango or GNOME theme selected.
  Open the Settings Manager and select Appearance. Inside dialog box switch
  to the Icons tag and select the "Adwaita" entry in the list.

20150304:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl
  AUTHOR: vsevolod@highsecure.ru

  After upgrading of libressl you should manually update all packages that
  depending on this library since its version has been changed. Normally,
  you could obtain the list of dependent software by running the following
  command:

  pkg query -e '%n = libressl' %ro

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on libressl to avoid dangling
  shared library dependencies.

20150301:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ruby20
  AUTHOR: swills@FreeBSD.org

  The default ruby version has been updated from 2.0 to 2.1.

  If you compile your own ports you may keep 2.0 as the default version by
  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep ruby 2.0 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=ruby=2.0

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  software that uses ruby. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  upon how you manage your system.

  If you use pkgng, simply upgrade:
  # pkg upgrade -f

  If you use portmaster, install new ruby, then rebuild all ports that depend
  on ruby:
  # portmaster -o lang/ruby21 lang/ruby20
  # portmaster -R -r ruby-2.1

  If you use portupgrade, install new ruby, then rebuild all ports that depend
  on ruby:

  # pkg delete -f ruby portupgrade
  # make -C /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portupgrade install clean
  # pkg set -o lang/ruby20:lang/ruby21
  # portupgrade -x ruby-2.1.\* -fr lang/ruby21

20150227:
  AFFECTS: Users of games/trigger
  AUTHOR: makc@FreeBSD.org

  games/trigger has been split and renamed to games/trigger-rally
  and games/trigger-data ports. Deinstall previous version
  before upgrading.

20150224:
  AFFECTS: Users of devel/qt4-linguist
  AUTHOR: makc@FreeBSD.org

  Linguist tools have been moved from qt4-linguist port to new
  devel/qt4-linguisttools port. Deinstall qt4-linguist before
  upgrading.

20150224:
  AFFECTS: Users of lang/ruby19

  lang/ruby19 has reached its end-of-life and has been removed.  The
  default version has been 2.0 for a while.  Other available versions
  are Ruby 2.1 and Ruby 2.2.

  Users who have DEFAULT_VERSIONS=ruby=1.9 in their /etc/make.conf are

  AFFECTS: Users of net-p2p/bitcoin (cli utilities)

  The bitcoin-cli and bitcoin-tx utilities have been re-packaged into
  a separate port. If you require these programs, or use the bitcoin-cli
  program to access the daemon or the GUI, install net-p2p/bitcoin-utils
  to reinstall them.

20150220:
  AFFECTS: users of PHP

  The default PHP version has been updated from 5.4 to 5.6.

  If you use binary packages you should make a list of php packages
  before running 'pkg upgrade':

  # pkg info php5\* > ~/installed-php-ports-list

  After the upgrade, check with such list if all your php extensions
  are still installed, and reinstall them if needed.

  AFFECTS: users who upgraded from FreeBSD 7.x or older with "make world" but never ran "make delete-old"
  AUTHOR: antoine@FreeBSD.org

  Dependency registration has been reworked.
  If you encounter the following error,  you may have stale magic files
  for file(1):

    ===>   bar-x depends on shared library: libfoo.so - not found

  You can remove the stale /usr/share/misc/magic.mime{,.mgc} files
  manually or run "make delete-old" in ${SRCDIR}.

20150207:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/opensmtpd-devel
  AUTHOR: ashish@FreeBSD.org

  MYSQL, PGSQL, LDAP, and REDIS options are removed from port, as
  they're moved upstream to a separate project, which is yet to
  release snapshots. If you need those options, then please install
  "mail/opensmtpd" port instead. To do that:

  If using portupgrade:
  # portupgrade -o mail/opensmtpd mail/opensmtpd-devel

  If using portmaster:
  # portmaster -o mail/opensmtpd mail/opensmtpd-devel

20150206:
  AFFECTS: users of net/serviio
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  The java dependency changed from java 7 (java/openjdk7 if you haven't
  installed another java 7 implementation) to java 8 (e.g. java/openjdk8).
  If serviio is the only reason that java 7 is installed, you can delete
  java 7 after the update to serviio 1.5.0.

  The Java Polling Watch Service used in Serviio 1.5 aggressively searches
  for file system updates. Until the Serviio poller is re-enabled in 1.5.1,
  consider unchecking "Keep library automatically updated" if you have a
  large media collection or are concerned about CPU/disk usage.

20150204:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql55-(server|client)
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  The default MySQL version has been updated from 5.5 to 5.6.

  If you compile your own ports you may keep 5.5 as the default version by
  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep MySQL 5.5 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=mysql= 5.5 

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  running server instance. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  on installed packages.

  # pkg set -o databases/mysql55-client:databases/mysql56-client
  # pkg set -o databases/mysql55-server:databases/mysql56-server
  # pkg upgrade

20150118:
  AFFECTS: users of www/thttpd
  AUTHOR: danfe@FreeBSD.org

  thttpd was updated to version 2.26, which brings several user-noticeable
  changes to the port:

    - Default WWW root was changed from ${PREFIX}/www/data to more expected
      (and standard) ${WWWDIR} (${PREFIX}/www/thttpd), be sure to check and
      adjust your thttpd configuration file and/or web layout accordingly;
    - Default CGI pattern was changed to "/cgi-bin/*"; this goes better in
      line with default installation;
    - Default data MIME type was changed to "application/octet-stream";
    - thttpd's own htpasswd(1) program, which was previously installed as
      thttpdpasswd(1) to avoid conflict with other webservers, is now being
      renamed to thtpasswd(1); this not just makes it shorter, but is more
      consistent with popular GNU/Linux distributions;
    - Index pages for directories are not generated by default from now on
      for security reasons; an option (INDEXES) is provided to turn them
      back on if they are wanted;
    - IPREAL option (to respect (pass on) "X-Forwarded-For" header) is now
      turned on by default: it is often required when thttpd is used as a
      CGI server behind nginx (http://wiki.nginx.org/ThttpdCGI).

20150113:
  AFFECTS: users of www/pecl-http
  AUTHOR: vanilla@FreeBSD.org

  The pecl-http has been upgraded to version 2.1.4, and the new version is
  not compatible with the old one.  If you need the "old" 1.7.6, you can
  find it in www/pecl-http1.

20150111:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/python3
  AUTHOR: demon@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of python3 has changed from 3.3 to 3.4.
  If you wish to stick with older version, add "python3=3.3" to your
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS variable in /etc/make.conf.  To upgrade:

  If using portupgrade:
  # portupgrade -o lang/python34 lang/python33

  If using portmaster:
  # portmaster -o lang/python34 lang/python33

20150109:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/speex
  AUTHOR: tijl@FreeBSD.org

  The audio/speex port has been updated to 1.2rc2 and one of the libraries
  it installed has been split off into a new port audio/speexdsp.  Before
  you can update audio/speex you must first delete the old package using
  "pkg del -f speex".

20150101:
  AFFECTS: users of net/unison and net/unison-nox11
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  Unison has been upgraded to version 2.48, which uses a different wire
  protocol than 2.40 did.  In order to support synchronization with
  other computers where Unison is still at version 2.40, a new port
  net/unison240 has been created.  It provides unison240 and if that is
  GTK2-enabled, also unison240-text.  This unison240 port can be
  installed in parallel with the existing net/unison port.

20141230:
  AFFECTS: users of deskutils/xpad
  AUTHOR: jgh@FreeBSD.org

  deskutils/xpad has been moved to deskutils/xpad3, since 4.x has been around
  for a while.

  Should you wish to stick with legacy branch at this time;

  # portmaster -o deskutils/xpad deskutils/xpad3

20141225:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/png
  AUTHOR: antoine@FreeBSD.org

  The PNG library has been updated to version 1.6.16.  Please rebuild all
  ports that depend on it.

  If you use portmaster:

  If you use portupgrade:
        portupgrade -fr graphics/png

20141224:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/neon29
  AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  The port www/neon29 was renamed to www/neon and updated to version 0.30.1

  If you use pkg, simply upgrade:

	# pkg upgrade

  If you use portmaster, rebuild ports that depend on neon:

	# portmaster -o www/neon www/neon29
	# portmaster -R -r neon

20141219:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/xorg and all xorg ports
  AUTHOR: dumbbell@FreeBSD.org

  The X.Org server (x11-servers/xorg-server) is updated to 1.14. All
  ports which provide X.Org drivers must be updated simultaneously, i.e.
  x11-drivers/xf86-*, emulators/virtualbox-ose-additions, net/tigervnc,
  etc.

  The input device autodetection backend is switched from HAL to devd.
  If you configure your keyboard layout through HAL .fdi files, you need
  to migrate this configuration to plain X.Org configuration files.

  Up-to-date instructions and a description of the changes brought by
  this update are detailed in a blog post:

  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/xymon-server
  AUTHOR: feld@FreeBSD.org

  Xymon has been updated to 4.3.18. A major change is the replacement of
  the individual cgi shell scripts with symlinks to a cgi program written
  in C. This is to mitigate shellshock on Linux systems where the
  /bin/sh -> /bin/bash. FreeBSD users were not exposed except in the
  most unusual and unsupported circumstances. However, this is an
  important update for security. This change could break your
  configuration as Henrik describes here:

  > NOTE: Replacing the shell script wrappers means that the cgioptions.cfg
  > file is no longer processed as a shell script. The new wrapper works
  > fine with the default version of cgioptions.cfg, but it you have

  AFFECTS: users of security/openssh-portable
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  OpenSSH 6.7 disables some insecure ciphers by default, such as arcfour
  and blowfish. You may have clients using these over LAN where security is
  considered less important for the connection. For these cases you may need
  to update your Ciphers entry in your sshd_config to enable them again.

20141217:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.*
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  Perl now links all .so it builds with libperl.so, it makes upgrading from one
  Perl major version to another way easier.  For binary package users, it means
  pkg upgrade will detect the libperl.so.x.yy change, and reinstall the
  affected packages.  For users using ports, it will save rebuild time as it's
  easier to detect what ports really need to be rebuilt.

  Ports users are encouraged to rebuild ports that install files in SITE_ARCH.
  If using Perl 5.18, run:

  With portupgrade:

    portupgrade -f `find /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/mach/5.18 -name '*.so'|xargs pkg which -qo|sort -u`

  With portmaster:

    portmaster `find /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/mach/5.18 -name '*.so'|xargs pkg which -qo|sort -u`

20141216:
  AFFECTS: users of security/openssh-portable, security/openssh-portable66
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  All patches have been fixed for version 6.7. It is no longer required to use
  the security/openssh-portable66 port.

  The LPK option was removed from security/openssh-portable as it has been
  deprecated since May 2013. Use AuthorizedKeysCommand as a replacement.

  AFFECTS: users of comms/spandsp-devel
  AUTHOR: pawel@FreeBSD.org

  comms/spandsp has been upgraded to version 0.0.6
  comms/spandsp-devel is now deprecated and set for removal, all ports using
  it were converted to use newer comms/spandsp. Before upgrade you must
  remove comms/spandsp-devel so that ports can pick up new dependency:

	# pkg delete -f spandsp-devel

  The CentOS ports are now the default for stable/10 (after revision 275807).
  See UPDATING entry 20141209 for details on migration of systems.

20141214:
  AFFECTS: users of TeXLive
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  Several scripts in print/texlive-base have been moved to
  devel/tex-kpathsea.  Upgrading them can fail because texlive-base
  depends on tex-kpathsea, and the new tex-kpathsea tries to install
  files which were installed by the old texlive-base.  The following
  error message indicates this situation:

    pkg-static: tex-kpathsea-6.2.0_1 conflicts with texlive-base-20140525_3 (installs files into the same place).  Problematic file: /usr/local/bin/kpsewhere

  To solve this problem, remove both of tex-kpathsea and texlive-base first
  and install the new versions:

	# pkg delete -f tex-kpathsea texlive-base

20141209:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/linux_base-f10 and emulators/linux_base-c6
  AUTHOR: xmj@freebsd.org

  The CentOS ports infrastructure has replaced Fedora 10 as default.

  1. Please delete all remaining f10 ports/packages:

     # pkg delete -f linux_base-f10 linux-f10-\*

  2. Persistently update the Linux kernel version in /etc/sysctl.conf:

     compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.18

    This step is necessary on all FreeBSD versions, apart from 11.0-CURRENT
    (after revision 271982).

  3. Reinstall all software depending on Linux emulation.
     As an example, reinstall linux-firefox:

     # portmaster -r linux-firefox
       or
     # portupgrade -f www/linux-firefox
       or
     # pkg install linux-firefox

  If difficulties are encountered, please follow the UPDATING entry 20140922
  but skip step 2 (OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE_PORT and OVERRIDE_LINUX_NONBASE_PORTS
  in /etc/make.conf). In case these steps do not fix the issues, please submit
  an issue report in Bugzilla and send an email to FreeBSD's emulation@ mailing
  list.

  Users who need to continue using Fedora 10 base and userland should do the
  following instead:

  1. Add these lines to /etc/make.conf:

      OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE_PORT=f10
      OVERRIDE_LINUX_NONBASE_PORTS=f10

  2. Downgrade the Linux kernel version in /etc/sysctl.conf on FreeBSD versions
     newer than and including 11.0-CURRENT (after revision 271982).

       compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.16

  This is all that is needed to continue using an existing Fedora 10 Linux base
  and userland.

  AFFECTS: users of devel/gettext (close to everyone)
  AUTHOR: tijl@FreeBSD.org

  The devel/gettext port has been split up in devel/gettext-runtime, a
  lightweight package containing runtime libraries, and devel/gettext-tools,
  a package containing developer tools.  The devel/gettext port still exists
  as a metaport.

  You must first delete the existing installation of gettext and then
  reinstall it.  This will break sudo, so you *must* do this in a root
  shell (sudo -i) if you use sudo.

  # pkg delete -f gettext
  # portmaster devel/gettext

  Or for portupgrade users:

  # pkg delete -f gettext
  # portinstall devel/gettext

  Or for binary users:

  # pkg delete -f gettext
  # pkg upgrade

	portsnap extract

  If using subversion:

	svn revert -R

  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/x264
  AUTHOR: xmj@FreeBSD.org

  With the recent split of multimedia/x264 in library and binary and library
  components, if an application that uses libx264 is updated before x264 itself,
  multimedia/libx264 will conflict with the existing x264 package. Delete
  this package before continuing any update that depends on it:

	# pkg delete -f x264

  Install the updated x264 and/or upgrade the other applications that
  depend on libx264, such as ffmpeg.

20141126:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.*
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The directories where Perl modules are installed has changed.  All
  affected ports' PORTREVISION have been bumped, so upgrading should
  be as painless as possible.  The old directories have been kept in
  the default Perl @INC to make it even more painless.

  The default Perl has been switched to lang/perl5.18.  These examples
  are for switching from lang/perl5.16, if you are running a different
  version, replace lang/perl5.16 with the origin of the Perl you have
  installed.

  Binary package users:

    # pkg upgrade -f

  Portupgrade users:
    0) Fix pkgdb.db (for safety):
        pkgdb -Ff

    1) Reinstall new version of Perl (5.18):
        portupgrade -o lang/perl5.18 -f lang/perl5.16

    2) Reinstall everything that depends on Perl:
        portupgrade -fr lang/perl5.18

  Portmaster users:
        portmaster -o lang/perl5.18 lang/perl5.16

        Conservative:
        portmaster p5-

        Comprehensive (but perhaps overkill):
        portmaster -r perl5-

  Note: If the "perl5-" glob matches more than one port you will need to specify
        the name of the installed Perl package explicitly.  You can get its name
        by running: pkg info perl5

  Make a list of the installed ports:
  # pkg info > ~/installed-ports-list

  Delete the old and conflicting packages:
  # pkg delete clutter gnome-utils gnome-panel gnome-keyring vala-vapigen \

  For package users the following lines will be enough:
  # pkg upgrade
  # pkg install gnome3

  For ports users should do the following:
  # portmaster -a
  # portmaster x11/gnome3

  After these steps, check with the list we made earlier if your favorite
  ports are still installed, and reinstall them if needed.

  Wrong values will cause pkg to skip installing the setuid binaries
  on the system.

  Please check your configuration.

  AFFECTS: users of comms/usbmuxd
  AUTHOR: avilla@FreeBSD.org

  libusbmuxd.so was split from comms/usbmuxd into comms/libusbmuxd.
  Remove usbmuxd before upgrading to avoid conflicts:

	# pkg delete -f usbmuxd

  If you need the daemon usbmuxd(1), you can reinstall the package
  after the upgrade.

  AFFECTS: users of deskutils/calibre
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  The dependency on graphics/py-imaging in calibre has been changed
  to using the graphics/py-pillow port.

  Due to this change automatic updating of the port will not work
  correctly.

  It is suggested to remove calibre and py-imaging from the system
  and then reinstall calibre again using binary packages or ports.

  AFFECTS: users of net/foreman-proxy
  AUTHOR: mm@FreeBSD.org

  In version 1.6 Foreman Smart Proxy splits its configuration into multiple
  ruby files located in PREFIX/etc/foreman-proxy/settings.d.
  The configuration of each service (dhcp, dhs, bmc, etc.) has been moved
  into a dedicated file.

  You can use a bundled script to convert your old settings to new settings:
  PREFIX/share/foreman/extra/migrate_settings.rb

  AFFECTS: users of shells/bash
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  Bash supports a feature of exporting functions in the environment with
  export -f.  Running bash with exported functions in the environment will
  then import those functions into the environment of the script being ran.
  This resulted in security issues CVE-2014-6271 and CVE-2014-7169, commonly
  known as "shellshock".  It also can result in poorly written scripts being
  tricked into running arbitrary commands.

  To fully mitigate against this sort of attack we have applied a non-upstream
  patch to disable this functionality by default.  You can execute bash
  with --import-functions to allow it to import functions from the
  environment.  The default can also be changed in the port by selecting the
  IMPORTFUNCTIONS option.

  AFFECTS: users of net/asterisk and net/asterisk11
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  The asterisk ports have been modified to have the LUA option
  turned on by default to make such functionality available to users
  of binary packages.

  Some care should be taken before upgrading by people not using Lua
  to avoid the sample extensions.lua file from being loaded on reload
  after updating the asterisk port/pkg.

  Users compiling from ports not interested in LUA support are advised
  to disable the option before updating.

  People using binary packages(or not wanting to disable the LUA
  option in the port) not using the Lua functionality should add:

	noload => pbx_lua.so

  to the PREFIX/etc/asterisk/modules.conf file, if using the
  autoload=yes option in that same file. People not autoloading
  modules don't need to perform any special action.

  If asterisk is rebooted and the pbx_lua module gets loaded on a
  system were it should not, it will load the example extensions.lua
  configuration file adding unexpected logic to your dialplan. In
  such a case following the above steps and reloading asterisk will
  fix the problem.

  AFFECTS: users of emulators/linux_base-f10 and emulators/linux_base-c6
  AUTHOR: xmj@FreeBSD.org

  The complete drop-in replacement linux-c6 port infrastructure is in
  ports and will shortly replace the current linux-f10- ports as default.

  To switch to the linux-c6 infrastructure:

  0. Back up all your vital information!
  1. Remove the current linux base port and all linux-f10- ports:
       # pkg delete -f linux_base-f10 linux-f10-\*
  2. Add these lines to /etc/make.conf:
       OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE_PORT=c6
       OVERRIDE_LINUX_NONBASE_PORTS=c6
  3. Make sure no Linux application is running.
  4. Update the Linux kernel version in /etc/sysctl.conf:
       compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.18
     Make it take effect immediately:
       # sysctl compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.18
  5. Install emulators/linux-c6.

  These steps are usually sufficient. If there are difficulties, expand
  step 1 to:

  1a. Remove all ports which depend on the linux base port.
  1b. Remove the linux base port.
  1c. Clean the /compat/linux/ directory.

  If there are any other difficulties not fixed by these extended steps,
  please submit an issue report in Bugzilla and send an email to
  FreeBSD's emulation@ mailing list.

  AFFECTS: users seeing build errors about missing *.la files
  AUTHOR: tijl@FreeBSD.org

  We are in the process of adjusting or, if possible, removing libtool archives
  (*.la files) from all ports because they can otherwise cause overlinking
  between packages.  This is the problem where in the dependency chain A->B->C
  an extra link is added from A to C even if A does not use C directly.  This
  makes some updates to port C expensive because then both A and B have to be
  rebuilt instead of just B.

  This is mostly behind the scenes work that you won't notice.  In fact most
  ports have already been converted.  You may however run into build errors
  about missing *.la files if a port update in the past went wrong and left
  behind *.la files with references to other *.la files that are no longer
  there.  In this case, please run the following command:

  find /usr/local/lib -name '*.la' | xargs grep -l 'libfoo\.la' | xargs pkg which
  (Replace libfoo\.la with the *.la file that is missing.)

  This command will print a list of *.la files that refer to the missing *.la
  file and what package they belong to.  First, where it says "not found in
  the database", remove the *.la file.  After removing all such files, where
  it says "installed by package X", rebuild X.  Eventually the list printed by
  that command will be empty and the build error should be gone.

  AFFECTS: users of ports-mgmt/pkg, ports-mgmt/pkg-devel
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  Pkg has been updated to 1.3.7. This fixes registration and tracking of
  shared libraries. All earlier versions of Pkg incorrectly marked some
  shared libraries and used the wrong name for some.

  Please note announcement for special instructions at:
    http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-ports-announce/2014-August/000086.html

  - Users need to run 'pkg update -f' and 'pkg check -Ba' after upgrading to
    pkg-1.3.7 and before updating any other packages. This avoids needing to
    reinstall anything not needed due to changed shlibs.
     For binary package users:
      # pkg install ports-mgmt/pkg
      # pkg update -f
      # pkg check -Ba
      # pkg upgrade
     For port users:
      # make -C /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/pkg build deinstall install clean
      # pkg check -Ba
  - People building packages for serving to other systems need to rebuild
    all packages with 1.3.7.
